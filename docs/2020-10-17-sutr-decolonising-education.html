<p><em>17 Oct 2020</em></p>

<p>Today I attended a Webinar over Zoom, held by the organisation <a href="http://www.standuptoracism.org.uk/">Stand Up To
Racism</a>, called &#8220;Decolonise Now!
- Confronting Britain&#39;s Colonial Legacy&#8221;. It featured a board of panelists, and
attendees of the Webinar could partake in the discussion, either via the Chat
function or the &#8216;Raise Hand&#8217; function, which enabled you to actually appear on
the Webinar.</p>

<p>The Webinar is part of a broader virtual event over this weekend, including
a whole host of workshops to choose from.</p>

<p>Although the Zoom events are finished, there is a rally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A99DOxorBw0">today at 17:00
BST</a>, and tomorrow at 17:00 BST,
which is being livestreamed via
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-OPYD39yTM6Xx3wG3epyKQ">YouTube</a> and
Facebook.</p>

<p>The webinar I attended was hosted by Venda Premkumar.</p>

<ul>
<li>Britain does not want to confront its racist past because that would mean
also confronting its racist present.</li>
<li>Black people and Black culture are not celebrated in education</li>
<li>Turn Black history into something that we teach all year round, as opposed to
for just one month (Black History Month)</li>
<li>Shift this Euro-centric norm</li>
<li>As this crisis deepens, the British State will seek to make scapegoats out of
migrants and everyone who bears the brunt of this racist system</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Victoria%20Showunmi">Victoria Showunmi</h3>

<ul>
<li>The concept of eugenics has shown its ugly face</li>
<li>Black Lives Matter is significant because it is making people start to think

<ul>
<li>They have had to take notice because they have been at home for the past
6 months</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The oppressors will try to portray the victims as the oppressors instead</li>
<li>There are lots of white people who place themselves in a &#8220;white saviour&#8221;
role, thinking that that is what it means to be an ally

<ul>
<li>If you want to be a true ally, you need to be selfless, and give the
microphone to those who are marginalised - not whitesplaining</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Khadija%20Mohammed">Khadija Mohammed</h3>

<ul>
<li>We constantly sideline the race agenda all the time</li>
<li>Longstanding problem of institutional discrimination

<ul>
<li>Absolutely no shortage of evidence to show this</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Confusion about the term &#8220;decolonising the curriculum&#8221;</li>
<li>It is not just about the topic that is taught

<ul>
<li>It is more about <em>how</em> it is taught and critiqued</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There has been a paradigm shift</li>
<li>Who makes knowledge? How do we know what we know?</li>
<li>Racism is pervasive - in everyday society, in educational settings</li>
<li>What is the boundary between allyship and white-saviourship?</li>
<li>&#8220;Decolonising the mind&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Anna%20Rothery">Anna Rothery</h3>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;Step Up Step Forward&#8221; event - working with businesses and organisations</li>
<li>Lack of Black teachers and Black social workers</li>
<li>We need a robust business model for for how &#38; why Black people can be at the
centre of organisations and businesses</li>
<li>We need to have a constructive and accountable manner</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Nadia%20Sayeed">Nadia Sayeed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Over the summer BLM has changed the terrain when it comes to fighting racism</li>
<li>In universities, we need to tackle the institutional racism that staff and
students face</li>
<li>It&#39;s about so much more than the statues

<ul>
<li>This is only a small part of the discussion</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Racism around exclusion rates &#38; attainment gaps</li>
<li>There was something bigger about BLM this time around</li>
<li>Students: Can you organise a &#8216;decolonise&#8217; meeting?</li>
<li>Whatever we do about decolonising education, it <em>must</em> be linked to the wider
struggle against racism</li>
<li>Racism will put people on the sharp end of crises such as economic struggles
and the Covid-19 pandemic</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.alternativecurriculum.org">https:&#47;&#47;www.alternativecurriculum.org</a></li>
<li>Take control of the curriculum</li>
<li>Colleagues are not always as supportive as they <em>think</em> they are being</li>
<li>Everything has got to change</li>
<li>There are ways in which <em>every single subject</em> can and should change</li>
<li>Racist pushback by the state</li>
<li>Lots of institutions had to rethink their own attitudes after the Colston
statue fell</li>
<li>Funding was threatened by government when institutions have tried to have
these discussions about their own statues</li>
<li>Lots of government cover-ups about this, involving absolutely foul and
disgusting behaviour by government officials</li>

<ul>
<li>With dissertations, don&#39;t just leave them collecting dust in a drawer - try
and actually <em>implement</em> them</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Daniel%20Kebede">Daniel Kebede</h3>

<ul>
<li>There will be the inevitable question of Churchill when it comes to the
discussion about statues</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="%3Cem%3EDiscussion%3C/em%3E-2"><em>Discussion</em></h3>

<ul>
<li>You can&#39;t just add &#8220;Decolonisation&#8221; as an appendage to the curriculum - you
have to fully integrate it, and center it around the children&#39;s lives and
experiences</li>
<li>Make sure Black people don&#39;t just have the shit jobs in schools</li>
<li><a href="http://www.prasi.org/">http:&#47;&#47;www.prasi.org&#47;</a></li>
<li>November is Islamophobia Awareness month - SUTR will be holding events</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Khadija%20Mohammed-2">Khadija Mohammed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Even the term &#8220;unconscious&#8221; is problematic because it draws the attention
away from the victim and gives the attention to the perpetrator</li>
<li>Why aren&#39;t we seeing anti-racist <em>practices</em> in the curriculum?</li>
<li>It&#39;s not good enough to say &#8220;I&#39;m not racist&#8221; - you need to be actively
<em>anti-racist</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Anna%20Rothery-2">Anna Rothery</h3>

<ul>
<li>We need to increase the number of Black teachers</li>
<li>Not education for education&#39;s sake

<ul>
<li>We need to enable people to <em>use</em> this knowledge that they have gained in
their lives</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Increase opportunity for people who are marginalised</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Victoria%20Showunmi-3">Victoria Showunmi</h3>

<ul>
<li>Old-fashioned terminology</li>
<li>We need to acknowledge colourism as well - it needs to be part of the
discussion</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Nadia%20Sayeed-2">Nadia Sayeed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Racism is so deeply ingrained in society</li>
<li>You can get support for organising meetings and anti-racist movements from
SUTR</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Daniel%20Kebede-2">Daniel Kebede</h3>

<ul>
<li>The discussion is too watered-down</li>
<li>Go on strike!</li>
<li>Black children will often outperform what white teachers predict</li>
<li>It is alienating for Black students not to see themselves reflected in
education

<ul>
<li>It is also a problem for white students as they see a distorted version of
history</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
