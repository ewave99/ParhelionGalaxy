This static site is generated by a script called [ssg5](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html). It was written by Roman Zolotarev and works with markdown files and simple HTML templates.

I also looked at his [style.css](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/style.css) and pasted snippets of it into mine, along with some Google Fonts ("[Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display)" for headings, "[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) " for the rest)

Check out his site / blog here: <https://www.romanzolotarev.com>

I also created a short script to automate the adding of entries for posts on the main page. It also prepares the markdown file for the post with a template (title, date, link back to main page). Check out [the repository for this site on GitHub](https://github.com/ewave99/ParhelionGalaxy) for that.
