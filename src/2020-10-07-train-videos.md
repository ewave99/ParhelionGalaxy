# Scenic Train Ride Videos
*07 Oct 2020*

About December last year, I heard about these kinds of videos from an old
family friend. I was quite ill with a stomach bug at the time, and thought I'd
give them a try.

It's a pretty minimal format - a slow-moving, almost unedited video of a long,
scenic train ride from the driver's point of view.

I felt myself drifting off, blissfully losing myself more and more in the
journey I was being taken on.

Here are some of my favourites:
