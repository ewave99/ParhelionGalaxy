# Notes on Stand Up To Racism Zoom Webinar: "Decolonise Now! - Confronting Britain's Colonial Legacy"
*17 Oct 2020*

Today I attended a Webinar over Zoom, held by the organisation [Stand Up To
Racism](http://www.standuptoracism.org.uk/), called "Decolonise Now!
- Confronting Britain's Colonial Legacy". It featured a board of panelists, and
attendees of the Webinar could partake in the discussion, either via the Chat
function or the 'Raise Hand' function, which enabled you to actually appear on
the Webinar.

The Webinar is part of a broader virtual event over this weekend, including
a whole host of workshops to choose from.

Although the Zoom events are finished, there is a rally [today at 17:00
BST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A99DOxorBw0), and tomorrow at 17:00 BST,
which is being livestreamed via
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-OPYD39yTM6Xx3wG3epyKQ) and
Facebook.

The webinar I attended was hosted by Venda Premkumar.

### Daniel Kebede:
- Britain does not want to confront its racist past because that would mean
  also confronting its racist present.
- Black people and Black culture are not celebrated in education
- Turn Black history into something that we teach all year round, as opposed to
  for just one month (Black History Month)
- Shift this Euro-centric norm
- As this crisis deepens, the British State will seek to make scapegoats out of
  migrants and everyone who bears the brunt of this racist system

### Victoria Showunmi
- The concept of eugenics has shown its ugly face
- Black Lives Matter is significant because it is making people start to think
  - They have had to take notice because they have been at home for the past
    6 months
- The oppressors will try to portray the victims as the oppressors instead
- There are lots of white people who place themselves in a "white saviour"
  role, thinking that that is what it means to be an ally
  - If you want to be a true ally, you need to be selfless, and give the
    microphone to those who are marginalised - not whitesplaining

### Khadija Mohammed
- We constantly sideline the race agenda all the time
- Longstanding problem of institutional discrimination
  - Absolutely no shortage of evidence to show this
- Confusion about the term "decolonising the curriculum"
- It is not just about the topic that is taught
  - It is more about *how* it is taught and critiqued
- There has been a paradigm shift
- Who makes knowledge? How do we know what we know?
- Racism is pervasive - in everyday society, in educational settings
- What is the boundary between allyship and white-saviourship?
- "Decolonising the mind"

### Anna Rothery
- "Step Up Step Forward" event - working with businesses and organisations
- Lack of Black teachers and Black social workers
- We need a robust business model for for how & why Black people can be at the
  centre of organisations and businesses
- We need to have a constructive and accountable manner

### Nadia Sayeed
- Over the summer BLM has changed the terrain when it comes to fighting racism
- In universities, we need to tackle the institutional racism that staff and
  students face
- It's about so much more than the statues
  - This is only a small part of the discussion
- Racism around exclusion rates & attainment gaps
- There was something bigger about BLM this time around
- Students: Can you organise a 'decolonise' meeting?
- Whatever we do about decolonising education, it *must* be linked to the wider
  struggle against racism
- Racism will put people on the sharp end of crises such as economic struggles
  and the Covid-19 pandemic

## Discussion Section

### *Discussion*
- <https://www.alternativecurriculum.org>
- Take control of the curriculum
- Colleagues are not always as supportive as they *think* they are being
- Everything has got to change
- There are ways in which *every single subject* can and should change
- Racist pushback by the state
- Lots of institutions had to rethink their own attitudes after the Colston
  statue fell
- Funding was threatened by government when institutions have tried to have
  these discussions about their own statues
- Lots of government cover-ups about this, involving absolutely foul and
  disgusting behaviour by government officials

### Victoria Showunmi
- With dissertations, don't just leave them collecting dust in a drawer - try
  and actually *implement* them

### Daniel Kebede
- There will be the inevitable question of Churchill when it comes to the
  discussion about statues

### *Discussion*
- You can't just add "Decolonisation" as an appendage to the curriculum - you
  have to fully integrate it, and center it around the children's lives and
  experiences
- Make sure Black people don't just have the shit jobs in schools
- <http://www.prasi.org/>
- November is Islamophobia Awareness month - SUTR will be holding events

### Khadija Mohammed
- Even the term "unconscious" is problematic because it draws the attention
  away from the victim and gives the attention to the perpetrator
- Why aren't we seeing anti-racist *practices* in the curriculum?
- It's not good enough to say "I'm not racist" - you need to be actively
  *anti-racist*

### Anna Rothery
- We need to increase the number of Black teachers
- Not education for education's sake
  - We need to enable people to *use* this knowledge that they have gained in
    their lives
- Increase opportunity for people who are marginalised

### Victoria Showunmi
- Old-fashioned terminology
- We need to acknowledge colourism as well - it needs to be part of the
  discussion

### Nadia Sayeed
- Racism is so deeply ingrained in society
- You can get support for organising meetings and anti-racist movements from
  SUTR

### Daniel Kebede
- The discussion is too watered-down
- Go on strike!
- Black children will often outperform what white teachers predict
- It is alienating for Black students not to see themselves reflected in
  education
  - It is also a problem for white students as they see a distorted version of
    history
